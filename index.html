  <h3>I'm a student Columbia University, studying Computer Science, Sociology, and Entrepreneurship</h3>



<h2>Interests </h2>

<p>It's pretty hard to generalize my interests, but I'm especially curious about the
  intersections between computer science and the social sciences. Specifically, I'm trying
  to answer the question of "how can we use technology to make the world a better place?"
   I'm still not sure, but my experiences thus far have mostly had to do with a mix of
    education and entrepreneurship.</p>

    <p>Some of the things I've been involved with:</p>


<li><a href="http://www.launchsummer.org">MIT Launch</a> - A 4 week summer program that helps high school students start companies. I'm currently interning at the program as an Education Coordinator.
</li>

<li><a href="http://www.landme.org">Landme.org</a> - A company I co-founded during my senior year of high school, with the mission of bridging the education gap by making summer opportunities accessible to students of all economic backgrounds.
</li>

<li><a href="http://www.citizenschools.org">Citizen Schools</a> - A nonprofit organization that helps inner-city students apply their classroom learning to professional areas. Citizen Schools allowed me to teach CS to middle school students at the Orchard Gardens K-8 school in Boston.
</li>

<li><a href="http://www.doe.mass.edu/STEM/standards.html">MA Department of Education</a> - In the past year, the MA Department of Education has been trying to revitalize CS education in the state of Massachusetts. I'm currently a panelist of the Board of Education, helping to rewrite their Computer Science & Digital Literacy Standards.
</li>

<h2> Hobbies </h2>

<p>The impulsive decision to join my school’s wrestling team taught me early on that I can be the
  happiest when I keep an open mind and experiment with the unfamiliar.  It’s because of this mentality
   that I like to dabble with a lot of different things at once. I’ll do my best to summarize some of
   those things below.</p>

  <li>Grappling - Although my four-year wrestling career ended in high school, I’m looking for ways to continue pursuing my interest in combat sports in college. Especially appealing at the moment is Judo, which seems to have quite a following at Columbia. </li>
  <li> Reading - I’ll admit I’m not the best at finding time to read. But when I do, I find it it just as hard to stop. Some recent favorites are Capital In the 21st Century, Zero to One, and the Game of Thrones series.</li>
  <li> Television - Yes, I watch an unhealthy amount of TV. All-time favorite series are The Wire, Hannibal, and Arrested Development.  </li>
