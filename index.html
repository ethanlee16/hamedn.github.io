  <h3>I'm a student Columbia University, studying Computer Science, Sociology, and Entrepreneurship</h3>

<h2> Interests </h2>

<p>It's pretty hard to generalize my interests, but I'm especially curious about the
  intersections between computer science and the social science. Specifically, I'm trying
  to answer the question of "how can we use technology to make the world a better place?"
   I'm still not sure, but my experiences thus far have mostly had to do with a mix of
    education and entrepreneurship.</p>

    <p>

Some of the things I've been involved with:
MIT Launch - A 4 week summer program that helps high school students start companies. I'm currently interning at the program as an Education Coordinator.
Landme.org - A company I co-founded during my senior year of high school, with the mission of bridging the education gap by making summer opportunities accessible to students of all
Citizen Schools - A nonprofit organization that helps inner-city students apply their classroom learning to professional areas. Citizen Schools helped to teach at CS to middle school students at the Orchard Gardens K-8 school in Boston.
MA Department of Education - In the past year, the MA Department of Education has been trying to revitalize CS education in the state of Massachusetts. I'm currently a panelist of the Board of Education, working on a project to rewrite their Computer Science & Digital Literacy Standards.
